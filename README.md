# Radnight

> Dark mode for Statamic 3 Control Panel.

## Installation

Require it using Composer, as well as the Pusher library.

composer require andymnewhouse/radnight
```

### Known Issues

- Catagorize columns contrast is terrible. This is because the svg has the stroke defined in the svg so css won't change it
