# Radnight

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Looking for a new maintainer, if you're interested reach out!

> Dark mode for Statamic 3 Control Panel.

## Installation

Require it using Composer.

```
composer require andymnewhouse/radnight
```

### Known Issues

- Catagorize columns contrast is terrible. This is because the svg has the stroke defined in the svg so css won't change it

### ToDo/Ideas

- Width % on Blueprints/Fieldsets
- Toggle in navbar rather than using system preferances
- Different dark themes, current uses Tailwind's Cool Gray, so maybe using True Gray also
